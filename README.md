# Construction Object Detector

This is very useful and efficient beacause a lot of accidents happened on some construction sites. So the workers, have to wear helmets and vests because of safety reasons.
My detector will detect the creditionals of a worker when entered into some construction site.

Run the file and train your model by `detector.ipynb`.
